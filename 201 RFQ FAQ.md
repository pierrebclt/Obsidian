Indiquer ici la liste des questions et des réponses que l'on peut apporter au client.

Nous allons aussi pouvoir affiner le mode de fonctionnement.

## Elements d'analyse

### General information
Question to confirm the feasibility :
- What is the application of the customer ?
- Environment (gas) ? (eg: Helium)
- Pressure ?
- Inlet max temperature (for cooling)?
- If seals, what kind of  seals will be used ?

### Compressor / Turbine information
Question we need to confirm the feasibility :
- Compressor or Turbine ?
- Need a Motor (if compressor) / a Generator (if turbine) ?
	- If yes 
		- what is the Power @ Speed ?
		- What will be the grid voltage ?
			- Usually 380V China or US, 460V in xx, 750V for BoilOff
	- If no what is the speed ?
- Number of stages ?
- Impeller weight and data (needed for rotor dynamic)

### Dynamique du rotor

Question we need to confirm the feasibility :
- Is rotor flexible ?
- Value of the first bending mode ?

### Thermal
- Inlet max temperature (for cooling)?
- Temperature management ?
- What will be the cooling of the motor and the bearings ?
- What are the ambiant temperatures ?

### Standards
What standards will be required ?

### Motor / Generator
- Depending on customer, we may manage that part
- Drive with Active or Passive front End ?

### Specific to the application
For instance for nuclear applications ?


### General information to be aware to answer the customer

Important points :
- ==Customer specification== : Do we have detailed specification from the customer ? If no can we ask to have it in order to move forward in the analysis of the opportunity ?
- ==Prestudy== : Do we need to ask the customer to pay for a prestudy in order to get :
	- The outcome will be a review of the specification with a deviation list, lay-out drawing with a solution (with original or modified customer rotor), compete rotor dynamics study with a standard report, mechanical interface checks and a basic thermal assessment.
	- This prestudy may be a prerequisite to confirm the NRE and lead time for the machine
- ==New customer & not off the shelf== : If new customer and not off the shelf, then ask for a target price
- ==If we want to offer the customer== : If we want to offer the customer we need to remember them the following facts :
	- What will be our scope of supply ?
	- What could be the estimated prototype lead time ? Preserial lead time ?
	- Rough prototype cost ? Rough serial cost ?
- ==To decide later== : how to answer to very complex opportunities (moutons à 5 pates) avec un minimum d'effort et des équipes dédiées ?

Commentaires Askar 07.03 nucléaire

Dear Joanna,

As discussed today with the team, below is a summary of our joint review of the RFQ from Wolong:

The application is micro-SMR PM generator coupled to a compressor ([1.5MW@21,6](mailto:1.5MW@21,6)krpm). No radiation. No critical nuclear application. The motor rotor is flexible with the value of 1-st bending mode ~ 250 Hz (!). The temperature of Helium in the AMB cavity varies from 100°C up to 150°C (!). The pressure is 16 bara. The detailed compressor data is missing.  Preliminary data based on the China Nuclear Power Engineering Co. (CNPE) specification indicates that this is a 21-stage compressor operating above the 2-nd flexible mode. However, this specification mentions the competitor’s solution: Jiamusi’s PM stand-alone generator with two-section rotor and hollow shaft + compressor from non-identified OEM. This is not Wolong’s & compressor OEM specification.

The bid date is March 9 and Wolong wishes to participate proposing the SKF solution.

Based on the mentioned above, this is a challenging project, and we might have no off-the-shelf solution. Formal specification from Wolong and compressor OEM is missing. It would be impossible to realize a pre-study in a such short period of time.

Proposal: offer to Wolong a feasibility study. The price may range from 50 K€up to 110 K€(depending on the eventual specification). The duration may vary from 3 to 6 months. The outcome will be a review of the specification with a deviation list, lay-out drawing with a solution (with original or modified customer rotor), compete rotor dynamics study with a standard report, mechanical interface checks and a basic thermal assessment. The NRE & hardware price/engineering & manufacturing lead-times could be established after the feasibility study. I hope that this approach will be acceptable to Wolong and CNPE.

Question du client :

We are working on New product development of a centrifugal compressor and will require a permanent magnet motor with 200kW and 74000 RPM. Requesting you for the quotation for the same.

Proposition JDT 03.01:

Also can I ask you about few more questions :

You are mentioning 200kW @ 74000 RPM.

Is it for a stage design ? I think yes it is.

What is the typical impeller weight and natural axial for your are expecting to have on this duty point ?

What are the ambient temperatures  ? Is 45°C ambiance fine for considering a water motor cooling ?

Are you looking for a 380V grid or different grid voltages possibilities ?
