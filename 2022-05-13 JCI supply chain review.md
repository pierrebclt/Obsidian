#### Notes

<u>Shipment of next week for Cienega</u>
Taking 9 weeks at the moment.
Shipment by air MBC, and M6 modules according the email of Erick.
Nancy said if 10 to 15 pallets, it can be a full container.

<u>General shipments for Cienega</u>
They have agreement for one container/month.

<u>PO direct to Vernon</u>
Ok for Nancy & Erick.

<u>LOB workbook</u>
We need to use the 2 templates until the LOB is fully ready to manage our shipments.
To Tim, we could be able to have 2 rows, like air and sea shipments.
