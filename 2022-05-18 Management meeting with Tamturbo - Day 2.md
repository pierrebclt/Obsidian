Meeting of yesterday : [[2022-05-17 Management meeting with Tamturbo]]

## Notes

<u>ORC</u>
Juha said ORC laboratories

<u>O&G</u>
We can support them to develop the business
Brett mention how the SKF engineers could be used to support the service

<u>Service</u>
Brett said we want to keep the control on the core parts, and give maintenance of little components to the distributor.
Regular maintenance need to be trained (business of Atlas Copco).
For Tamturbo, the maintenance will be so seldom than the skill can be made by very few people on remote.

<u>Presentation of Igor</u>
Volumes :
- 2020 : 10
- 2021 : 25
Turnover :
- 2020 : 2M€
- 2021 : 6M€

Today:
- backlog = 11 compressors, mainly TT325
- portfolio = 35 compressors (145 & 185 is 25%)

For Igor, currently the TT145 & 185 is needed too powerful motors (for cables etc)
But he sees the possibility to increase sales, and it should represents at least 25% of the sales.

- Brett :
	said they need our support to the business model
	It it a clear requirement from the market, and in terms of cashflow they need
	Our scope in the total cost of a project is 10%, in the machine we represent 15%
	Profitability :
	- low machines : they don't do
	- larger machines : they do it more profitable
Product sales management and turn key projects are 2 different business models

<u>Service model + warranty extension </u>
They want to go to 10 years
Igor said they have this extension warranty contract which is really expansive
- [ ] Discussion séparée #brett + #pierre
Igor said they sell 5 years, and extensible to another 5 years after the first visit.
Igor said they charge 10% vs Atlas Copco need to pay 100% every 6 years (=15%/year).
16 to 20k€ per year requested to the customer.

Maintenance Atlas copco ZB selling at 120K€, vs TT185 = 180K€ (50% installation/50% machine)
Yearly:
- They invoice 4K/year for maintenance.
- It cost them 2K
Overhaul on year 5:
- Overhaul cost 60% of machine = 60K€
- it cost Atlas Copco them 6K€

If they sell total responsability :
- 20K€/30K€ a year for AC
- Tamturbo wants to offer this contract for 10K€/year

<u>Marketing</u>
Igor wants more material is more presentations, pictures, animations

<u>Sourcing</u>
Frederic explained the costs increase from our supplier
He proposes permanent or specific temporary cost increase can be used
Igor mentionned that some of the margin was going to the country, which is a mailbox that passes the invoices.
For him we could look at what is used with SKF Finland as margin
Perttu said direct work would be even simpler
Tamturbo is buying nothing from SKF Finland
