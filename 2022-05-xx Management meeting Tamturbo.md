Thank you for the new agenda proposal. On our side there was one question regarding bigger motors in future compressors. Would it be ok to add this subject to technical review? I would propose to cover this subject so that we could first go through your current motor portfolio of bigger motors. After this we could open our target motor speed for bigger compressors.
