Frederic is wondering what kind of relationship we need to build with AMAT ?

#### Next actions
- [ ] I need to suggest who in my team to contact *Karthik Venkitesh* for inputs, segment by segment to know what is common, and what is specific to each segment

#### Mes idées
- Make sure some patents by OEM could block us for some market (eg: AC patent on Aircom 20 yeas ago
- Direct income : at the moment we don't do it but should we consider it (turbomolecular pumps ?). Especially if we know the strengh of our position is not high
